# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Improve Evidence Synthesis Production Efficiency

The repository contains data and code for the study described in the protocol Muller, A.E., Berg, R.C., 
Meneses-Echavez, J.F. et al. *The effect of machine learning tools for evidence synthesis 
on resource use and time-to-completion: protocol for a retrospective pilot study.* 
Syst Rev 12, 7 (2023). [https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-023-02171-y](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-023-02171-y)

Analysis was performed using Stata 18. In addition to Stata, the analysis code uses two external programs,
git and sips, which are used for revision control and image file format conversion, respectively. The code
requires these tools to be available on your system path (a Mac or Linux environment is assumed). If you do not
have these tools installed, the code should be trivially editable to remove these dependencies.
